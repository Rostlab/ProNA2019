# ProNA2019
ProNA2019: System predicting protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-protein binding sites from sequence
ProNA2019 can predict protein-DNA, protein-RNA and protein-protein binding sites with only sequence information. 
It is a two level prediction. In first level, ProNA2019 will predict whether the input protein is a binding protein. 
If the input protein is a binding protein, then ProNA2019 will give the residue level prediction.
